# A/B Testing

Digital Marketing A/B Testing with CHATGPT Data

This project is aimed to explore A/B Testing with artificial data provided by CHATGPT4. It demonstrates not only understanding of Marketing Science concepts, but also the capabilities of ChatGPT4 as a learning and practice tool. 

Dataset and Variables

We are given with 23 columns of data about 3000 artificial user information for a digital marketing campaign. The columns are ‘UserID’, ’Group Age’, ‘Gender’, ‘Location’, ‘Device’, ‘PageViews’, ‘ClickThroughRate’, ‘SessionDuration’, ‘FrequencyOfVisits’, ‘LastVisitDate’, ‘SignUps’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Purchases’, ‘FormSubmissions’, ‘NetPromoterScore’, ‘MostActiveTimeOfDay’, ‘ContentConsumed’, ‘UserJourneyPathway’, ‘FeatureInteraction’,	‘LayoutVariation’, ‘ColorScheme’, ‘CTAButton’.

Users are divided into Test and Control groups equally, each group receiving different CTA Button and Color Scheme.

The project starts with descriptive statistics, continues with Bootstrapping and Chi-square test.
